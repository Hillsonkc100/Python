# what if there was no version control system?
=> If there was no VCS we would have to copy/paste the codes or use google drives for code sharing.

# Advantages of using version control system (VCS)
=> Tracks the history of your entire codebase
=> it helps to collaborate in a team
=> Maintain the code version

# version control system => git, mercurial, google VCS

# we should also keep our code somewhere in the cloud. It would be if the cloud supports git
# That's why we use GitHub

# Git commands
1. git config --global user.name username
    => sets the global git username
2. git config --global user.email email
    => sets the global git email

3. git config --global user.name
    => checks whether the username is set or not
4. git config --global user.email
    => checks whether the email is set or not

# In git the project folder is called git repository (repo)

1. git init
    => Initializes a repo in local

2. git add .
    => adds all the changes to the staging area

# If you do not want to push any file or folder to github then mention those files or folder in ".gitignore"

3. git commit -m "commit message"

4. git branch -m Main
    => changes the master branch to Main

5. git push -u origin <branch_name>

6. ssh-keygen
    => Generates an SSH public/private key-pair
    => Paste the public key to the Github settings

7. git remote add origin <ssh-link>
    => adds a remote of name "origin"

8. git remote -v
    => Lists all the remote links

9. git remote remove origin
    => Removes the remote link
